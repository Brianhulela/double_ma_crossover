This repository demonstrates the implementation of the **Double Moving Average Crossover Trading Strategy** using Python. The strategy involves using two moving averages (a short-term and a long-term EMA) to generate buy and sell signals. The code also includes a brokerage fee calculation and fractional share handling to simulate real-world trading scenarios.

Key Features:
- Calculation of the Exponential Moving Averages.
- Buy and sell signals generated based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term EMAs.
- Simulation of trading with fractional shares and fee deduction.
- Portfolio tracking and performance evaluation.
